# MVCNN
MultiVariate Convolutional Neural Network.
This work proposes a tensor scheme along with a novel deep learning architecture called multivariate convolutional neural network (MVCNN) for multivariate time series classification, in which the proposed architecture considers multivariate and lag-feature characteristics. We
evaluate our proposed method with prognostics and health management (PHM) 2015 challenge data.
